# Human-Activity-Recognition
This project focuses on analyzing and comparing machine learning techniques for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), a significant area in AI, ML, and ubiquitous computing, which aims to identify and predict human actions using sensor data. The project evaluates the performance of four models—Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, KNN, and Voting Classifier—using a consistent dataset to ensure fair comparison. By examining accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, this analysis sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of each model, aiding in the selection of the most effective approach for HAR applications.
